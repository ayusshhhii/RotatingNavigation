            <h1>Does Dog Breed Affect Behavior? In a Word, Yes.</h1>
            <small>Article on Dog Breed</small>
            <p>A recent study published in Science investigated whether a dog’s breed determines their personality, based on community science data sourced from Darwin’s Ark. Outlets like the New York Times framed the expansive study’s results with provocative headlines like, “They’re All Good Dogs, and It Has Nothing to Do With Their Breed,” but is it really that simple?

                “I think it’s dangerous to say to someone that it doesn’t matter what breed of dog you get … I’m really anxious about some of the messaging that’s out there about this paper,” study co-author Dr. Jessica Hekman said on the Cog Dog Radio podcast. She told the American Kennel Club that the study’s original intent was to add to the scientific literature about dogs in regards to behavior, and “not to provide guidance for people buying pets.”
                
                We spoke to dog experts in training, health, and genetics, as well as study co-author Hekman herself, to understand more about why dog breeds and genetics definitely do matter, and how socialization of any dog or breed is key to bringing out the best expression of a dog and their personality.

            <p>How Do You Bring Out the Best Behavior and Personality in Your Dog?
                You’ve likely heard of the “nature versus nurture” concept when it comes to dog behavior. A dog’s breed, hard-wired personality, and behavior traits are essentially the “nature,” while socialization and training are “nurture.” Leigh explains that socialization is the most important thing a person can do when they bring a new puppy home.
                
                “Positive experiences as a young puppy stay with the dog for life and will help it mature into a more confident, well-rounded adult dog,” she says. “Genetics also definitely play a role. Some breeds are naturally more reserved and less trusting of strangers—and some are social butterflies who love everyone from day one. Still, socialization helps all dogs adapt better to people, animals, and situations that they will encounter through life.”
                
                Another important way to bring out the best in your dog is to train your dog. For example, some breeds are high drive and easily aroused, but teaching impulse control and focus will help channel those qualities in positive ways. In other words, you can’t change the personality a dog is born with, but you can help bring out its best expression. Like a naturally shy person can use tools to build confidence in public speaking, you can give a timid dog the tools to be more confident and self-assured.
